## 📖 Data Story
Imagine you're a first-time investor looking to enter the U.S. housing market. You’re overwhelmed by choices—coastal mansions, suburban homes, urban condos. This analysis acts as your compass.
We start by cleaning the data to remove noise and inconsistencies. Then, we visualize trends to understand where your money goes furthest. You learn that while California dazzles with luxury, states like Texas and Ohio offer more square footage per dollar. You discover that 3-bedroom homes strike the best balance between affordability and livability.
By the end, you're not just looking at numbers—you’re seeing stories of neighborhoods, lifestyles, and opportunities.

## ✅ Recommendations
1. Focus on High-Activity States (California, Florida, Texas) : Since these states show the highest concentration of listings, investors and realtors should prioritize marketing and expansion strategies here to maximize visibility and potential sales.
2. Capitalize on Luxury Niches in Select States : Luxury properties are concentrated in fewer states. Realtors should develop tailored marketing strategies highlighting exclusivity, lifestyle, and amenities to attract high-net-worth clients.
3. Regional Affordability Strategies : In high-cost states (California, New York), highlight rental investment potential due to demand , In more affordable regions (Midwest, South), focus on attracting relocators, retirees, and remote workers seeking cost-effective housing options.
4. Price per Square Foot Analysis for Value Deals : Investors should consider states with larger, more affordable homes (low $/sqft) for rental or resale opportunities, while being cautious in states where smaller homes come at a high premium.
