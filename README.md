## 📖 Data Story
Imagine you're a first-time investor looking to enter the U.S. housing market. You’re overwhelmed by choices—coastal mansions, suburban homes, urban condos. This analysis acts as your compass.

We start by cleaning the data to remove noise and inconsistencies. Then, we visualize trends to understand where your money goes furthest. You learn that while California dazzles with luxury, states like Texas and Ohio offer more square footage per dollar. You discover that 3-bedroom homes strike the best balance between affordability and livability.

By the end, you're not just looking at numbers—you’re seeing stories of neighborhoods, lifestyles, and opportunities.
